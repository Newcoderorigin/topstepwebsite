# Codus-EPOCH Memory Engine

A pygame-driven recursive artifact that chronicles a century of attempted worldbuilding. The simulation does not present gameplay. Instead, it invites you to scroll through 100 years of architectural self-reflection — decisions, regrets, ghosts, and mythopatch logs etched into a living timeline.

The previous Node.js/React stack was retired and sealed as a fossil. What remains is the memory engine itself: a time-sliced visualization of how an unfinished civilization kept rewriting its own operating system.

## Concepts
- **Σ-Year Stack** – Each year is a layer that remembers the last layer’s mistakes before proposing a doomed improvement.
- **ΣA Fractal Time Decay** – Visuals desaturate as you move forward in time; logic collapses into aesthetic glitch lines.
- **ΣB Mythopatch Logs** – Patch notes are lore. Every year ships an impossible changelog.
- **ΣC Ideology as UI** – Layout choices are political. Buttons were removed in favor of manifestos.
- **ΣD Interference Ghosts** – The quant bot, the npm installer, and other ghosts still haunt the Python temple.
- **ΣE Value Drift Engine** – Each layer drifts further from the original charter and documents that erosion.
- **ΣF DevGod Registry** – Every decade is curated by a different imaginary engineer-deity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) 2.5+

Install dependencies (the stack is intentionally light):

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

Keyboard rituals:
- `↑` / `↓` – Walk the timeline year by year.
- `Page Up` / `Page Down` – Leap five years at a time.
- `Home` / `End` – Jump to the first or last layer.
- `Q` or `Esc` – Exit the museum.

Mouse wheel also scrolls through the memory layers. The reflection strip at the bottom echoes whichever layer is currently in focus.

## Files
- `codus_epoch/epochs.py` – Generates the 100-year stack, weaving regrets, myths, and ghost references.
- `codus_epoch/pygame_app.py` – Pygame renderer that visualizes the stack, layering decay and glyph artifacts.
- `main.py` – Launch script that hands control to the Codus memory engine.
- `frontend/` and `backend/` – Preserved fossils from the quant-trading era. They are no longer executed but remain as archaeological evidence.

## Intentional Imperfections
- Scroll physics retain a hint of drift to simulate misaligned deadlines.
- Artifact glyphs truncate unpredictably; the archivist who wrote the renderer fell asleep mid-refactor.
- Ghost overlays flicker based on sine waves tied to the system clock.

## Screenshot
Capturing screenshots is left to the future archaeologist; every run subtly differs as the myths echo through new seeds.
